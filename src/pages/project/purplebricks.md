I joined Purplebricks to work on delievery for a number of greenfield features for the product, which had recentley had a significant pivot. Working mainly on the front end, I delievered features such as a messaging chat app for agents, and the ability to book appointments based on the customer's postcode.

The team preferred to not use UI libraries, so I wrote all my frontend components from the ground up - an experience I found very valuable.

Languages: React, Typescript, Javascript
Tools: NextJS, Azure, Cypress, Jest, Git, Styled Components, GraphQL, Docker, Storybook, Figma, Bash, Sentry, zsh
