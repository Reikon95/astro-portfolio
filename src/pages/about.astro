        <p>
          I'm a frontend biased full stack frontend engineer with a little bit
          of enterpeneur sprinkled in. As a former technical recruiter before
          learning to code, I bring an unorthodox perspective to the table.

          Day to day, I work as a software engineer at Holland & Barrett and by
          night and at weekends I'm Co-Founder at The Coder Career, a careers
          network for people in tech!

          Outside work, my biggest hobby is rugby - I play for my local team
          here in Edinburgh and am a huge fan of the game. When I'm not clearing
          out a ruck or desperatley chasing down a speedy winger, I'm usually
          playing guitar, walking or hanging out with my girlfriend - and our
          cat Earl!
